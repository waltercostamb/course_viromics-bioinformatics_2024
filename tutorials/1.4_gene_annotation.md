# Gene annotation

Use Phanotate to annotate contigs: https://github.com/deprekate/PHANOTATE

Answer the following questions:

Before running the tool:  

- What is an ORF?
- How and why do you predict ORFs?
- Would you expect ORFs to overlap on the genome?
- Would a tool for predicting ORFs in bacteria work for viruses?
- How do you know an ORF is really a protein coding gene?

After running the tool:

- What does the output file look like?
- How many ORFs did the predict predict?
- What is the longest ORF?
- Did you find any overlapping ORFs in a contig?
