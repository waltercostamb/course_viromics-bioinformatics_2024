# Documentation Theory

Documenting your work is crucial in Computational Biology/Bioinformatics. In this way you can make sure that your work is reproducible, 
you can transfer text to other documents, such as reports or papers and other people can access your work.   

You are required to write a Lab Book for this module, which will count as part of your evaluation. It must be in computational format (docx, 
google docs, markdown, latex, etc.). You should divide the lab book into sections (days) and add subsections for different tasks. 
Each subsection should have a meaningful title. Any relevant information should be included, such as websites used in searches, folders 
where you can find files and tool names and versions. An example can be seen in the link: 
https://github.com/waltercostamb/course_viral-microbiology/blob/main/tutorials/lab-book.pdf. Start your lab book today and write on it 
whenever necessary during the module. In the last day, send a copy to your advisor.
