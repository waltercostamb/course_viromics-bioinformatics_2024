# Documentation Theory

Documenting your work is crucial in Computational Biology/Bioinformatics. In this way you can make sure that your work is reproducible, 
you can transfer text to other documents, such as reports or papers and you can send parts of it to collegues, so that they can access your work.   

You are required to write a Lab Book for this module, which will count as part of your evaluation. It must be in computational format (docx, 
google docs, markdown, latex, etc.). You should divide the lab book into sections (days) and add subsections for different tasks. 
Each subsection should have a meaningful title, e. g. "Documenting module *Viromics-Bioinformatics*", "Download of phage sequences", "Evaluating sequence quality". Any relevant information should be included, such as websites used in searches, folders 
where you can find files, tool names and versions and bibliographic references. An example can be seen in the link: 
https://github.com/waltercostamb/course_viral-microbiology/blob/main/tutorials/lab-book.pdf. Start your lab book today and write on it 
whenever necessary during the module. In the last day, send a copy to your advisor.    

The paper "Ten Simple Rules for a Computational Biologistâ€™s Laboratory Notebook", by Santiago Schnell of 2015 offers interesting insights: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385 Most relevant rules: 4, 6, 10. One outdated point for Bioinformatics is to keep hard copies of your lab book. I suggest keeping only digital copies with backup and using smart options, such as Latex, which organizes your references and numbering of figures. A Latex template can be found here: https://github.com/waltercostamb/Lab-Book/blob/master/lab-book.tex
