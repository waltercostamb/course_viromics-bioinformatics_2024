# Evaluating sequencing quality 

We will use Nanoplot to evaluate the quality of your nanopore sequences. Read the README page of the tool: https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot. Follow the tutorial to run the tool locally using your sequences as input. Analyse your output and write a summary of your analysis and conclusion in your lab book.  

In your analysis, consider if the quality scores of your bases and sequences are good. What is a reasonable threshold to use for a base to be of good quality? Use trusted sources to justify your statements.
