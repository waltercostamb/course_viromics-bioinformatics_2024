# Introduction to Computational Biology

## Objectives

Learn about algorithms and sequence alignment. Alignment is one of the most important topics for computational biology and the basis for the project's experiments: assembly, phage classification and annotation. Answer the following questions with an online search.

The following book, by Prof. Manolis Kellis, was used for a course on Computational Biology and contains several topics that are relevant for our module: https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.047/f15/MIT6_047F15_Compiled.pdf Read the following sections and summarize their key points in your lab book:

---------

- Read pages 25 to 30 of chapter "SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT AND DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING"  
- Read section "2.4.1 Theory of Dynamic Programming"
- Read section 2.4.3

If there is time:

---------

- Try out the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for different sequences in: https://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/index.jsp?toolName=Needleman-Wunsch
- Read pages 34 to 39 "2.5 The Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm"
