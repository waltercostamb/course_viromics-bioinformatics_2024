# Assembly I

## Theory

Watch the following lecture by Prof Bas E. Dutilh "Sequence alignment": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgdfZTA-J3o  

Read about assembly in Prof. Manolis Kellis's book (pages 93 to 98): https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.047/f15/MIT6_047F15_Compiled.pdf    

BLAST: series of lectures of Prof. Robert Edwards on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A-msg23u0w

Summarize the material in your lab book.  

## Practice

Use Metaspades to assemble the sequences: https://cab.spbu.ru/software/meta-spades/. Alternatively, you can also use canu https://canu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html. As a basis for this experiment, you can use the following link from Dr Aldert Zomer (Section "Assembly"):  https://aldertzomer.github.io/Microbial-Genomics-2022/30_Assembly/index.html Note that he used another assembly tool. We need to adapt this tutorial to Metaspades. As a guide, answer the following questions along with the ones of Prof Zomer's tutorial:

-----

- What is this tool for?
- Is is adequate for the type of sequencing we are analysing?
- Which command line can you use to assemble your sequences?
