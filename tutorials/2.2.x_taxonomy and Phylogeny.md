# Taxonomy and Phylogeny

- How can you make a phylogeny of viruses?
- Pros vs cons of making phylogeny with marker gene vs full genome
- Choose a marker gene to create your phylogeny: what was the most frequently annotated PHROG?
- Align your marker genes (MAFFT, clustalw, etc.)
- Use iqtree to build the tree
- Use iTOL or iroki https://www.iroki.net/ to visualize the tree
